# Rulesets and Gaia DDL

Every rule must refer to a catalog entity defined in the DDL for that application.

Although DDL source code and Rule source code exist in separate source files and are compiled and translated separately (DDL first, followed by rules), they are always considered together when reading a rule's logic. It follows that a DDL change forces a re-translation of the rules that refer to the catalog entries generated by the DDL.

In addition to identifying the names of tables and the fields within those tables, the DDL defines the relationships between tables. Unless the DDL shows a relationship between two tables, there can be no navigation directly from one to the other.

For more information on the Gaia DDL, see [Gaiac and DDL](gaiac-ddl.md).
